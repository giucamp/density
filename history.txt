***************************************

version 2.00.00 - API BREAKING - changes:
    - removed the template parameter COMMON_TYPE from runtime_type and heterogeneous queues
    - feature tables (used by runtime types) are now constexpr static objects
    - feature list supports nesting, duplicate removal, f_none. runtime_type takes a variable number of feature and feature lists
    - removed the namespace type_features. Now builtin features have an f_ prefix and they are defined the namespace density
    - moved the sources of the library under an include/ directory (from density/ to include/density)

version 1.04.01 - changes:
    - fixed crash when raw_atomic_compare_exchange_strong failed and m_next_ptr was set to 0 (causing move_next called for an empty consume)

version 1.04.00 - changes:
    - lifo_array: iterators are now classes (and not pointers)    
    - renamed default_allocator and basic_void_allocator to default_allocator and basic_default_allocator
    - removed the progress_guarantee parameter from try_allocate of the UntypedAllocator concept
    - removed mixed atomic and non-atomic operations on the same location
    - added clang thread sanitizer to the test matrix
    - lock-free queues review, many bugs fixed
    - using clang-format

version 1.03.00 - changes:
    - polishing (removed many unnecessary detail::)
    - fixed *::consume_operation::element not compiling in case of virtual inheritance (and added test cases)
    - fixed *::consume_operation::unaligned_element_ptr returning a wrong pointer in case of virtual inheritance (and added test cases)
	- added pdf document that explains the implementation

version 1.02.00 - changes:
	- fixed a serious bug of heter_queue::const_iterator (indirection returning a reference to a temporary)
	- test: added commandline parameter -print_progress:[0|1]
	- continuous integration: benchmarks are now executed on every build
	- doc fixes and improvements

version 1.01.00 - changes:
	- fixed lifo space catastrophe: with a specific allocation-deallocation pattern, much of the capacity of the pages was wasted
	- fixed lifo_array not deleting copy constructor and assignment
	- improved lifo testing, added statistics
	- default queue test cardinality is now 2000 (it was 1000)
	- documentation update
